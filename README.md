## Code corresponding to Nonparametric Independence Testing for Right-Censored Data using Optimal Transport

This repository contains the optHSIC algorithm proposed in  `Nonparametric Independence Testing for Right-Censored Data using Optimal Transport', https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03866. 
It is an algorithm for independence testing between a continuous, potentially high dimensional covariate and a right-censored lifetime (that is, we have observed the minimum of the event 
time of intereste and a censoring time, as well as an indicator variable equal to 1 if the event is uncensored. 

## Dependencies

The code relies on the python packages ot, kerpy, multiprocessing, scipy, numpy, pandas.

## Further code will be made available soon
